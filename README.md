> _Rules Against The Machine_ ðŸ¤˜

The rules engine to rule them all.

## TODO

- [x] Simplify TS, making `Rule[]` the sole recursive type.
- [x] Avoid `eval` parsing.
- [x] Use reduced JS syntax, scope.
- [x] Use context for input and output.
- [ ] Add support for multiple boolean expressions. (`&&` and `||`).

## Prior Works & Research

- JSON Rules Engine - the Microsoft one
- json-rules-engine - the HE one
- GitHub Actions YAML's conditional syntax

## Example Rules

```json
[
  {"if": {"and": ["price >= 25", "price <= 50"]}, "then": "discount = 5"},
  {"if": "price >= 100", "then": "discount = 20"},
  {"return": "discount"},
]
```
